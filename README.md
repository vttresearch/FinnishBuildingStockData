A Julia module for processing Finnish building stock data.
Originally designed for the building stock structural data in
[*Finnish building stock default structural data*](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:att:6c6697fc-c601-40b7-a1c9-ad85b0423d38),
as well as the optional detailed data in
[*Finnish building stock detailed RT-card structural data*](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:att:61b72dc7-2e51-4598-bd65-95b099fabd0c),
along with the building stock statistical data in
[*Finnish building stock forecasts for 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050*](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:att:a567a84b-fea4-4ca8-84a1-fe97f52caff4),
and processes them into something usable by the [ArchetypeBuildingModel.jl](https://github.com/vttresearch/ArchetypeBuildingModel).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>2024-08-16: The *FlexiB* project funding this research is ending, making it unlikely that this module will receive see further active development.


## Key contents

1. `process_datastore.jl`, the main program file.
2. `process_datastore.json`, the [Spine Toolbox](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox) tool definition for the main program above.
3. `src/FinnishBuildingStockData.jl`, the main module file.
4. `scripts/` contains a few example scripts for using this module.


## Installation

Similar to other Julia modules, this module is installed via the Julia `Pkg` package manager.
However, since this module is not included in the *Julia General Registry*,
it cannot be installed using the standard `add` command.
Instead, the module needs to be downloaded manually and installed using the `develop` command:

1. Download the contents of this repository onto your computer, e.g. by cloning the repository.
2. Start Julia and enter the package manager by pressing `]`.
3. `activate` the desired Julia environment, or not if you want to work in the main environment.
4. Install the module using the `develop` command with a path to the folder housing the `Project.toml` file of this module.


## Usage

This module is intended to be used as a part of a [Spine Toolbox](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox) workflow,
with the following rough steps:

1. Create a Spine Data Connection referring to the `datapackage.json` in [`finnish_building_stock_forecasts`](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:att:a567a84b-fea4-4ca8-84a1-fe97f52caff4).
2. Create a Spine Importer with the `import_finnish_building_stock_forecasts.json` specification from [`finnish_building_stock_forecasts`](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:att:a567a84b-fea4-4ca8-84a1-fe97f52caff4).
3. Create a Spine Data Conenction referring to **AT LEAST** the `datapackage.json` in [`finnish_default_structural_data`](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:att:6c6697fc-c601-40b7-a1c9-ad85b0423d38), and optionally to the corresponding file in [`finnish_RT_structural_data`](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:att:61b72dc7-2e51-4598-bd65-95b099fabd0c) as well.
4. Create a Spine Importer with the `import_finnish_structural_data.json` specification from [`finnish_default_structural_data`](http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:att:6c6697fc-c601-40b7-a1c9-ad85b0423d38).
5. Create a new Spine Datastore, and connect the above Importers to it.
6. Create a Spine Tool with the `process_datastore.json` tool specification.
7. Create a new Spine Datastore as the output for the `process_datastore` tool.
8. Define the input and output database urls as keyword arguments for the `process_datastore` tool.

Naturally, as a Julia module, one can also access the functionality of this module from Julia by
```julia
julia> using FinnishBuildingStockData
```
However, this is only necessary for more advanced usage.


### Working outside Spine Toolbox

In v2.0.0, functionality was added to read and process data outside Spine Toolbox in order to
save processing time when dealing with large datasets. At the time of writing,
Spine DB API can be a bit slow when reading and manipulating large databases.
See `scripts/raw_data_testscript.jl` for at least some guidance how this functionality works.


## Documentation

[Online documentation is hosted here](https://vttresearch.github.io/FinnishBuildingStockData/),
but so far I haven't bothered to set up automatic workflows for keeping it up to date.
Thus, for accessing the newest documentation, one has to build it locally
by performing the following steps:

1. Activate the `documentation` environment from the Julia Package manager
```julia
julia> ]
(FinnishBuildingStockData) pkg> Activate documentation
(docs) pkg> ]
julia>
```

2. Run the `documentation/make.jl` script.
```julia
julia> include("documentation/make.jl")
```

3. Open the newly built `documentation/build/index.html` to start browsing the documentation.
